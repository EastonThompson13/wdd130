        <h2>Easton Thompson</h2>
        <p> Hey everyone! My name is Easton Thompson! I am from Gilbert Arizona and I am currently a Junior here at BYU-Idaho studying computer sccience.</p>
        <p> I love to play sports and I play competitive volleyball for a club team here in Rexburg and it has been a blast! </p>
        <p>One thing that I love about BYU_idaho is the fact that I can get a quality education and learn to be a better disciple of Christ while doing it. </p>
        <p>I am really excited to learn more about web design. This is my second semester in the degree of computer science so I feel like I am still a bit of a noob when it comes to this stuff but I do find all of it very interesting and that's why I stay in the field.</p>
